# Description
This script is used to create EMC/Dell XIO snapshots used for backups or SUP refreshes of the Epic EMR system. It could be used for other purposes as well.

A snapshot is kept for each day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc) to offer multiple restore points. A RW snaphsot as well as a Read Only snapshot is already created. A SUP snapshot is created as well. The below is a summary of the snapshots created:

	The script will create the following SnapShot sets:
		CGName-SUP	== For SUP (Read/Write)
		CGName-RW	== Clone mounted for backups (Read/Write)
		CGName-RO	== Extra Clone (Read-Only)
		CGName-MON	== Clone refreshed every Monday
		CGName-TUE	== Clone refreshed every Tuesday
		CGName-WED	== Clone refreshed every Wednesday
		CGName-THU	== Clone refreshed every Thursday
		CGName-FRI	== Clone refreshed every Friday
		CGName-SAT	== Clone refreshed every Saturday
		CGName-SUN	== Clone refreshed every Sunday

The script automatically creates the necessary initial snapshot sets, as long as the consistency group is created ahead of time.

# Installation

On RHEL, the following commands will ensure all required modules are installed. It has been a while since I have done a fresh install of this script, so please let me know if anything has changed.

yum install perl
yum install perl-libwww-perl
yum install perl-MailTools
yum install perl-CPAN
perl -MCPAN -e "install Mail::Sendmail"
yum install perl-LWP-Protocol-https.noarch

# Configuration

You will need to modify several variables within the script for it to function in your environment. They are listed below.

Line 16 ($xms): Configure the XMS server managing the XIO.

Line 19 ($clname): Define the cluster name. You can find this by logging into XMS.

Line 22 ($username): Username which has 'configuration' role in XMS. I recommend this be different than your admin account and be specific for this purpose.

Line 25 ($password): Password for the above account.

Line 28 ($cgname): The consistency group name for the LUNS you wish to snapshot. This is required, as Epic will have multiple LUNS supporting the environment.

Line 31 ($mailto): The email address you want output to go to when NOT using the --no-mail option. By default, the script sends all output to email. Separate multiple addresses with a semicolon (;).

Line 34 ($mailfrom): The email address automated email should be sourced FROM.

Line 37 ($mailsubject): The subject for automated emails.

Line 40 ($logfile): The path where the log file should be stored.

In the freeze_cache() function, line 201, modify this command to suite your environment. You'll need to have key-based SSH authentication working for the user calling the script if you are running this script from a server other than the server running Cache.

In the thaw_cache() function, line 217, modify this command to suite your environment. You'll need to have key-based SSH authentication working for the user calling the script if you are running this script from a server other than the server running Cache.

In the unmount_mount function, if you want to unmount and re-mount the clone (useful for a SUP refresh), you'll need to modify lines 387 & 388 for your filesystems. 

# First Run

After the script is created, you'll want to run the script with the --create-snapshot-sets option first. This will create all of the initial snapshots!

# Useful options

! Useful for refreshing SUP via ENVCopy. This WILL unount and re-mount the file systems listed in the script
./xio_epic_snap.pl --sup-only

! Refresh all clones EXCEPT SUP and do not remount any file systems
./xio_epic_snap.pl --all --no-mount --no-sup

! To call from your backup start command. This will refresh ALL snapshots excep SUP and will remount the file systems listed in the script.
xio_epic_snap.pl --all --no-sup
